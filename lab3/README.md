## ECG Analysis, Pan - Tompkins Algorithm
* The ECG analysis lab focused on the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, a widely used method for detecting QRS complexes in ECG signals. The algorithm was implemented in Python using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. The lab began with an overview of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm and its components, including bandpass filtering, differentiation, squaring, and integration. The algorithm was then applied to a sample ECG signal, and the results were visualized using graphs. The lab concluded with a discussion of the algorithm's performance and potential improvements.
