## Dataset Management, Windowing, Signal Analysis

The digital signal processing lab covered several essential steps. It started by reading data from a CSV file, a crucial task for any subsequent analysis. Data visualization was then carried out using graphs, which provided a first impression of the nature of the data and possible patterns. Windowing was then applied to divide the data into specific segments, allowing for more detailed and focused analysis at specific intervals. Analyzes of zero crossings and identification of maximum peaks were performed, both with and without windowing, demonstrating how these techniques can reveal important signal characteristics.

In this project, a procedure was initiated to examine the data, including dividing it into specific size intervals and calculating various signal measures such as IEMG, MAV, and SSI for each interval. Python was used along with libraries like Pandas and NumPy to efficiently manage the data and perform the necessary calculations. The analysis results were then organized into a data format for easy manipulation and visualization. This approach allowed for a detailed understanding of the behavior of the signals in different sections of the data, which was essential for the analysis and interpretation of the collected data.
